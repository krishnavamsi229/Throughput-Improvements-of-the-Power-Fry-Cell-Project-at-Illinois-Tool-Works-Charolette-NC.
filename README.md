# Throughput-Improvements-of-the-Power-Fry-Cell-Project-at-Illinois-Tool-Works-Charolette-NC.
This is one of my course project at UWM
## Project Abstract:
The main objective of the project is to increase the throughput from 8 tanks per day to 13 tanks per day. This goal is set to decrease the current order backlog the company faces. With a decrease in backlog and an increase in throughput, a secondary goal can be implemented to decrease the overall customer lead time from 22 weeks to 6 weeks.
The first section of the project will be to analyze the current capabilities of the Power Fry line and the second section will be dedicated to potential alternatives. 
MCTs will be used to help draw inspiration or areas of improvement.
